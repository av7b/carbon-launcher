# Carbon - Launcher

This is the complete, full source of the Carbon launcher.

You may run whatever tests you want on the built .exe file that you built on Visual Studio, and/or you may scan the Program.cs file for any suspicious acts.

If you have any inquiries, contact **av7b** on Discord. That is the only person you should go to.
